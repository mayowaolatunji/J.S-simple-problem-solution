# LOGICAL OPERATORS

## Logical OR 

There are cases in code where we want to say "this condition" or "this other condition". If either of the conditions are true, let's do something!

It would be quite ugly to write this with if statements every time:

```
if(car) {
    driveToAirport();
}
else if(motorcycle) {
    driveToAirport();
}
else if(truck) {
    driveToAirport();
}
```

If we needed to change the driveToAirport function, we would have to change it in 3 places. It is beneficial to adhere to the principle of code DRYness, which stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." Whenever feasible, it is advisable to minimize code redundancy and strive for efficient reuse.



Let's try to accomplish the same functionality with the Logical OR (||) operator:

```
if(car || motorcycle || truck) {
    driveToAirport();
}
```

### Task 1

Complete the willEat function. The three arguments will be boolean values (true or false). If any of them are true, return true.

```
function willEat(hasPizza, hasDonuts, hasCookies) {
    
}

module.exports = willEat;
```

## Default Operator

In the last section,  we referred to || as the Logical OR operator.

This operator is also sometimes referred to as the default operator due to its behavior with truthy and falsy values.

Take, for example: `console.log("" || "Something Else"); // Something Else`


`const message = WELCOME_MESSAGE || "Hello there!";` 

 Here the message is guaranteed a truthy value even if WELCOME_MESSAGE is empty.

And it's not just limited to empty strings either:

`const age = user.age || 99;`

 If user.age is undefined or 0 we will default to 99. For that matter user.age could be any falsey value and it would default to 99.
