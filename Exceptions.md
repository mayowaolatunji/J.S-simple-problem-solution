# Exceptions


Exceptions play a crucial role in various programming languages as they allow for throwing and catching unexpected errors.

When a function encounters an exception, which is an unforeseen error, it may not have the necessary means to handle it. In such cases, the exception is thrown. This action halts the execution of the current function and returns control to the function that invoked it. The calling function has the option to catch the exception and manage it within its own context. If the exception goes uncaught, it will continue to propagate up the call stack until it reaches the highest level of the program.
